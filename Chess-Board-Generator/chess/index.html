Precursors to chess originated in India. There, 
its early form in the 7th century CE was known 
as chaturaá¹…ga.

Chess, as we know it today, was born out of the 
Indian game chaturanga before the 600s AD.  The 
game spread throughout Asia and Europe over the
coming  centuries , and eventually evolved into 
what we know as chess  around  the 16th century. 
One  of  the  first  masters  of the game was a 
Spanish priest named Ruy Lopez.
